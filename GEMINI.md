# Project Overview

This project is a static website generator for a quiz application. It takes quiz content defined in YAML files, converts Markdown-formatted questions and answers into HTML, and then renders them into a series of static HTML pages using Jinja2 templates.

The build process includes an automated accessibility audit to ensure the generated site meets WCAG standards.

**Key Technologies:**
*   **Python:** Used for the main build script (`build.py`) and the accessibility sub-agent (`check_accessibility.py`).
*   **PyYAML:** For parsing YAML content files.
*   **Jinja2:** Templating engine for generating HTML pages.
*   **Markdown:** For writing quiz questions and answers in YAML files.
*   **Node.js/npm:** For managing frontend dependencies.
*   **@axe-core/cli:** For running automated WCAG accessibility checks.
*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Frontend technologies.
*   **Picnic CSS:** A lightweight CSS framework used for styling.

The website consists of an index page, individual module (quiz) pages, a final score page, and a leaderboard page.

# Building and Running

The website is generated by running the `build.py` Python script. This script handles both the generation of static HTML files and the subsequent accessibility audit via a sub-agent.

**To build the website:**

1.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the build script:**
    ```bash
    uv run build.py
    ```

This command will:
1.  Read all `.yaml` files in the root directory.
2.  Convert Markdown content within the YAML files to HTML.
3.  Render all Jinja2 templates (`.j2`) to create the final HTML pages in the `dist/` directory.
4.  Call the `check_accessibility.py` sub-agent to run an audit on all generated HTML files.
5.  **The build will fail if any accessibility issues are detected.**

After a successful build, the generated HTML files will be available in the `dist/` directory.

**To run the website (after building):**

Simply open `dist/index.html` in your web browser. For local development, you might want to use a simple HTTP server:

```bash
uv run -m http.server --directory dist
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

# Development Conventions

*   **Quiz Content:** Quiz questions and answers are defined in `.yaml` files.
*   **Templating:** Jinja2 templates (`.j2` files) are used for the structure of the HTML pages.
*   **Styling:** The website uses the Picnic CSS framework, supplemented by custom styles in `style.css`.
*   **Build Process:** The `build.py` script is the main entry point for generating the site.
*   **Accessibility Sub-Agent:** The `check_accessibility.py` script is a dedicated sub-agent responsible for auditing the generated site. It is called automatically by `build.py` and uses `@axe-core/cli` to perform the audit. This ensures a separation of concerns between building the site and validating its quality.

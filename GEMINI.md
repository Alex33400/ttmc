# Project Overview

This project is a static website generator for a quiz application. It takes quiz content defined in YAML files, converts Markdown-formatted questions and answers into HTML, and then renders them into a series of static HTML pages using Jinja2 templates.

**Key Technologies:**
*   **Python:** Used for the build script (`build.py`).
*   **PyYAML:** For parsing YAML content files.
*   **Jinja2:** Templating engine for generating HTML pages.
*   **Markdown:** For writing quiz questions and answers in YAML files.
*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Frontend technologies.
*   **Picnic CSS:** A lightweight CSS framework used for styling.

The website consists of an index page, individual module (quiz) pages, a final score page, and a leaderboard page.

# Building and Running

The website is generated by running the `build.py` Python script.

**To build the website:**

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv run build.py
```

This command will:
1.  Read all `.yaml` files in the root directory.
2.  Convert Markdown content within the YAML files to HTML.
3.  Render `module.html.j2` for each module, creating files like `javascript.html` and `python.html`.
4.  Render `index.html.j2` to create `index.html`.
5.  Render `final-score.html.j2` to create `final-score.html`.
6.  Render `leaderboard.html.j2` to create `leaderboard.html`.

After running the build script, the generated HTML files will be available in the root directory. You can then open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.

**To run the website (after building):**

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. For local development, you might want to use a simple HTTP server:

```bash
uv run -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

# Development Conventions

*   **Quiz Content:** Quiz questions and answers are defined in `.yaml` files (e.g., `javascript.yaml`, `python.yaml`). Questions and answers within these files should be written in Markdown format.
*   **Templating:** Jinja2 templates (`.j2` files) are used for the structure and dynamic content of the HTML pages.
*   **Styling:** The website uses the Picnic CSS framework, supplemented by custom styles defined in `style.css`.
*   **Scripting:** Client-side interactivity is handled by multiple JavaScript files in the `js/` directory. A main `script.js` file dynamically loads the appropriate script based on the current page.
*   **Build Process:** The `build.py` script is the single source of truth for generating the static site. Any new modules or pages should be integrated into this script and the corresponding Jinja2 templates.
